Hello! This is a test blog post, as you are probably already aware if you read the above message. dfhalshfkjhflakshflkhflaksjhlkahsflkajsfh.
This should be a new paragraph. I can use HTML tags in here like <b>Bold (&lt;b&gt;)</b>, <strong>Strong (&lt;strong&gt;)</strong>, <i>italic (&lt;i&gt;)</i>and <em>Emphasis (&lt;em&gt;)</em>, and should be able to make lists: 
<list>
Walk nonexistant dog
Feed nonexistant dog
Feed nonexistant cat
write some code
</list>
I can even make ordered lists!

how to ride bike
<olist>
get bike
get on
fall off
learn to not fall off
you did it!
</olist>

also, what about both <b>bold AND <i>itatlic? Looks pretty emphasizy.</i></b>
